I am new to android and I have to say, editing text has been pretty annoying at times. I find tapping and placing the cursor in the right place can be a challenge many times. When editing text I usually want to insert a word, not add or delete characters within a word (since it is likely spelled correctly). On my previous iPhone, if I tapped a word near the beginning of the word, it automatically put the cursor at the beginning of the word. Then on the occasions I actually wanted to edit characters within a word, I would tap hold and it would insert the cursor where I picked up my finger.

The only way I can figure out to “guarantee” a cursor is placed before a word in Android is to do the following. Let’s say I currently have “This is a lot of fun!” typed into my text message box. Let’s say I wanted to insert the word “game” and instead say “This game is a lot of fun!”. I could try to tap right before “is” and hope I hit it just right, but half the time it doesn’t happen and I have to try again. It annoying because I want to be able to quickly edit text without having to worry or spend extra time “trying again” to place the cursor right. The only way I've found to “guarantee” that I won’t misfire is to tap in the middle of the word to the left of it, select the middle suggestion that comes up (which is the actual word) and it will then put the cursor before the word I am trying to add text to before it. So, in my example this means I would tap “This” in the middle, select “This” and then type “game”. 

This solution doesn’t really work though for inserting at the beginning of an entire message or email. I find often (too often) it puts the cursor before the 2nd character not the 1st (beginning).
